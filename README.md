## About 

Python 3 implementation of the Christofides Algorithm, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christofides_algorithm) for more details.

It shows step by step the execution of the algorithm, from the starting graph to the result.

## Prerequisites
[Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/), [NetworkX](https://pypi.org/project/networkx/), [MatPlotLib](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/)

## Updates 
There's still some conditions to apply in the main function, but it still works without them.
